SOC project-Interactive #D web development using three.js


I haven’t known anything about web development earlier. During this project, I learned the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First, I used HTML to create the structure of a webpage by adding things like headings, text, images, buttons, and forms. Then, I learned how to style the page using CSS. I changed colors, fonts, and layouts, and made the page look better by using things like Flexbox and Grid. After that, I used JavaScript to make the page interactive. I learned how to make things happen when users click buttons, how to check form inputs, show messages, and change content on the page. As a part of my practice, I made a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me understand how all three tools work together to build a real, working website. While working on the calculator, I also learned how to fix errors in my code and solve problems on my own. I also learned about the fetch API and the async/await functions, which are used to get data from servers. However, I haven’t used them in a project yet. This experience has made me more confident in my web development skills, and I look forward to using these new concepts in future projects.Now I will start learning three.js .
